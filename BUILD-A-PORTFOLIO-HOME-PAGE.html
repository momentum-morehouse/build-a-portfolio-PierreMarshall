        <p class> Hello! My name is Pierre Marshall.<br>
        <p>I'm here to share a little about myself with you<br>
        <p>I was born September 5th to Tommie and Jacqueline in Baltimore,MD <br>
        <p>I am als the youngest of three with a brother and sister<br>
        <p>While growing up in Baltimre my parents worked as a teacher and a frameworker for the now defunct C&P Telephone Company.<br>
        <p>With the combined working experience of my parents, I feel there was reasoning behind my journey of 20 years as Pyschiatric Rehabilitation Counselor assisting At-Risk youth for over 20 years. <br>
        <p> >By observing my parents I was able to combine the art of educating through communication the needs of my various populations served.<br>
        <p>Another attribute I have had the ability to demonstrate i being a great leader, role player and at times a coach through sports.<br>
        <p>As I fastforward to present time, I am pushing to bring all my skills to create momentum in the tech world with OHUB, Momentum and Morehouse College with this opportunity afforded to me.<br>
        <p>There are two places in which i can be reached online.<br>
